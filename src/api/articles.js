        <p>Applications doubled at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts last year, reaching 1,800 for 90 places, after it became the first institution in Scotland to receive a full accreditation from the Council for Dance, Drama and Musical Theatre. </p>
        <p>The academy, which employs 12 full-time staff and 45 contractors, expects revenues to nearly treble by 2023, from £1.3 million to £3.6m.</p>
        <p>It is also actively looking to expand its footprint, aiming to boost its current 15,000 square foot of studio and office space to 35,000sq ft.</p>
        <p>Co-founder Drew Gowland said the academy places a particular focus on the practical aspects of working as a performer, including regularly bringing in agents, union representatives, accountants and lawyers to share their insights.</p>
        <p>He said: “We make sure it is part of our on-going development. You can be the best performer in the world, but if you do not know how to write to an agent and sell yourself, then you will never get a job, and no one will ever see that talent.”</p>
        <p>Gowland, originally from Leeds, and his partner Murray Grant, from Edinburgh, secured an £85,000 loan in 2010 to establish their operation in a former Wheatsheaf pub in Balgreen, later adding two further venues as the academy grew.</p>
        <p>Recent graduates include West End performers Rhiannon Chesterman and Rebecca Stenhouse, as well as Disney film star Thomas Doherty, who will appear in the upcoming HBO/Sky mini series Catherine The Great, alongside Helen Mirren.</p>

        <p>The MGA Foundation will provide financial support to help with the fees required to attend a range of courses in singing, acting and musical theatre. </p>
        <p>Applicants will have to be able to demonstrate a genuine financial need and the potential to excel within the performing arts.</p>
        <p>The MGA Academy of Performing Arts has provided support for young people endeavouring to train professionally in Edinburgh since it was launched in 2010. The new MGA Foundation has been set up as a separate charity, which will broaden that access to include workshops, youth theatre and part-time and full-time training opportunities across the UK.</p>
        <p>Choreographer Murray Grant, a trustee of the new charity, told The Stage that setting it up was important to him because he could afford to attend Bird College in London only after he was given a full scholarship.</p>
        <p>He said: “Things are becoming more and more expensive and it is becoming a lot more out of the reach of a lot of talented people to be able to go to school and train.</p>
        <p>“That is not just full-time training, but kids going to summer schools and workshops and things like that. We, as a charity, want to give as many opportunities as possible to young people from Scotland in the performing arts.”</p>
        <p>In order to help the long-term sustainability of the charity, Grant said that those who were helped by it would be asked to commit to support it in the future.</p>
        <p>He said: “We want to make it a kind of a family thing where once you have had the scholarship for the three years of training and then you are then doing a West End show or whatever, you can then contribute to the foundation.</p>
        <p>“The hope is that, over the years, people who have been funded through the foundation will be paying for future generations in the way that we are doing it.”</p>

        <p>Phoenix Performing Arts College and WestSide Performing Arts recently took part in a masterclass from international choreographer and performer Murray Grant.</p>
        <p>Murray visited Dublin to give youngsters from Phoenix Performing Arts College in East Wall and WestSide Performing Arts in Lucan an insight into what is expected of professional performers by guiding them through a fun and engaging masterclass.</p>
        <p>He said: “I had a great time working with the students in Dublin as they were all focused and keen to learn.</p>
        <p>"It was great to be able to travel to Dublin to share my passion for the industry and hopefully inspire some future stars of the stage from the area.”</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Ennis, creative director of WestSide Performing Arts, said: “Murray sharing his knowledge, passion and enthusiasm for the industry is an invaluable experience for our students.</p>
        <p>"His professionalism, caring attitude and high energy in the studio not only brings out the best of each dancer but encourages them to push out of their comfort zone and improve their technical and performance ability.</p>
        <p>“The opportunity to work with Murray has been one of the highlights of the terms for our students.”</p>
        <p>The MGA Academy of Performing Arts is currently accepting applications for auditions in Ireland in February next year.</p>

        <p>This is a drop in café in the style of an airport lounge and it is now ready to welcome you if you just fancy a coffee or would-be performers who can go in and get career advice if they need it.</p>
        <p>It is a theatre-themed shop, resource and meeting place for local dancers, actors and performers.</p>
        <p>The Core on Glanville Place offers the opportunity to shop for all things theatrical, provide information on local performing arts events and offer guidance on opportunities to practise and train in performing arts across the city, including children’s classes, dance groups, and degree-level tuition. It will also host signings and talks by theatre stars, including performers from London’s West End.</p>
        <p>It is an unusual name and we asked Drew Gowland what was behind it. As a performer himself he knows all about the importance of the body’s core  to dancers and he explained the inspiration came from that.</p>
        <p>When you buy a coffee or a cake there is an optional donation to The MGA Foundation, the charity that will run the shop. This charitable organisation was established to enable performers to train for careers on stage regardless of their financial background.</p>
        <p>Drew Gowland co-founded the MGA Foundation along with Murray Grant said: “The Core shop will look and feel something like an inviting and relaxing airport lounge.</p>
        <p>“The shop will not only offer some incredible items for sale but it will also host regular events with some of the theatre’s biggest visiting stars so that our guests can meet and learn from the industry’s finest performers in a relaxed and accessible environment.</p>
        <p>“We will encourage people to pop in and engage with opportunities in dance, acting, and musical theatre in Edinburgh ‒ really any performing art, at any level, and for any age, audience or participant. We hope to do all of this whilst raising much needed money for The MGA Foundation.”</p>
        <p>With signed theatre memorabilia on the walls, the space will take on the atmosphere of a Hard Rock Café for stage aficionados, who will also be able to purchase show tickets across the UK at the shop’s on-site box office.</p>
        <p>The MGA Foundation was established earlier this year to ensure aspiring singers, dancers, actors and musical theatre performers are to be given financial freedom to pursue education in their chosen art at reputable schools across the UK.</p>
        <p>The founders of the charity, Drew Gowland and Murray Grant, have distributed more than £600,000 in tuition fees in the past ten years for students on part-time and full-time performing arts courses.</p>
        <p>Drew continued : “The establishment of a registered charity and our very own “charity shop (with a difference)” to continue our work and encourage even more people into performing arts training seemed like the natural next step.</p>
        <p>“It is so important that young people, regardless of their background, have the opportunity to find out about the wealth of opportunities out there in the performing arts and then be able to access them should they so wish.”</p>
        <p>Applications for funding from The MGA Foundation will be welcomed from mid-2019. Successful applications can secure funding to participate in classes, workshops, summer schools and youth theatre projects and even to train full-time on CDMT-accredited courses across the UK.</p>
        <p>The MGA Foundation is a Scottish registered charity (SC047592). For further information, visit  <a href="https://www.themgafoundation.org/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">www.themgafoundation.org</a> or email info@themgafoundation.org</p>

        <p>Those who attend Boys’ Scholarship Week will be given the opportunity to have fun while learning some tricks of the trade from guest tutors and staff from The MGA Academy.</p>
        <p>MGA recently became the first full-time professional training academy in Scotland to be awarded accreditation by CDET, the UK’s quality assurance and membership body for the professional dance, drama and musical theatre industries.</p>
        <p>It was co-founded in 2005 by choreographer Murray Grant and director Andrew Gowland to provide a platform for aspiring performers to remain in Scotland while studying at a level equivalent to prestigious London colleges.</p>
        <p>Murray Grant says: “I wanted to organise a project like this to give boys the opportunity to come along and meet others that share the same interests whilst learning more about acting, dancing and singing.”</p>
        <p><b>Thriving careers</b></p>
        <p>Many of MGA’s male graduates have gone on to secure thriving careers in the commercial performing arts. Thomas Doherty is now working for Disney and Fergal McGoff is performing in London’s West End.</p>
        <p>Grant added: “We’d like to encourage more boys to consider pursuing careers in the industry.</p>
        <p>“When I was growing up, I was always the only boy in drama classes and I wish opportunities like Boys’ Scholarship Week had been available then.”</p>
        <p>The week is completely free to attend, but places are limited and must be booked in advance.</p>

        <p>Fame The Musical, based on the 1980’s film Fame, tells the story of a group of young people studying at one of America’s top performing arts schools in New York.</p>
        <p>The show opens with the students auditioning to get into PA, the city’s High School of Performing Arts, but this production has a Scottish twist as one of the students is playing the bagpipes as his selected audition piece as he hopes to make it into the famous school.</p>
        <p>The choice of musical for this year’s Beyond Broadway Experience show couldn’t be more fitting for a group of young people interested in the world of the arts.</p>
        <p>It’s during the show’s opening number Hard Work that the main cast are introduced. Adam Craig has perfect comic timing as Joe, and has the whole audience laughing during Can’t Keep It Down as he attempts to make his affections known to Carmen.</p>
        <p>Caitlin Tipping gives a superb performance as Carmen, the fame-obsessed student whose tragic downfall weaves through the show. Carmen is also the affection of Schlomo, played by Gareth Williams, who gives a touching performance, especially on Bring on Tomorrow, a song performed in Carmen’s memory.</p>
        <p><b>perfect pairing</b></p>
        <p>Reuben Woolard and Melissa McNaught are a perfect pairing as students Nick and Serena. They work well together, especially in the second half of the show when their relationship grows. McNaught’s rendition of Let’s Play a Love Scene is simply stunning – she captivates the audience to the point where you could hear a pin drop.</p>
        <p>The singing talent of the cast throughout the show really is first class and there’s not a note out of place. Megan Forbes and Charmain Leitch, who play teachers Miss Bell and Esther Sherman, give a stunning performance of Teacher’s Argument, and Sarah Kerr hits some incredibly high notes during Mabel’s Prayer giving her one of the biggest cheers of the night.</p>
        <p>Rory Macleod gives a fantastic performance as Tyrone, a hip hop dancer who struggles with the academic side of school. One of the dance highlights of the show is Dancin’ on the Sidewalk which sees the entire ensemble dancing with Tyrone commanding the stage with his every move. The choreography, by co-founder of MGA Murray Grant and Louise Ferrier, is clever, original and fun. There are ballet numbers, contemporary moves and some of the cast even do backflips across the stage.</p>
        <p>The Beyond Broadway Experience has really tapped into some wonderful talent in his production. As the show comes to an end we’re treated to the classic song Fame we’ve been waiting for as the yellow taxi appears in the middle of the stage and the cast burst into song.</p>
        <p>An utterly brilliant production from a hugely talented cast. There are many times throughout the show when you forget this is a youth performance, a true testament to the calibre of the young people on the stage.</p>

        <p>The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh was founded by Murray Grant and Andrew Gowland in 2005, developing from small-scale workshops into a renowned College and “Centre of Excellence”, to study for a professional career in musical theatre, dance and drama. </p>
        <p>TEN, illustrated by the Roman numeral X (like the X Factor logo), is a dazzling, dynamic show and celebrates the range of theatre productions which have been performed by the MGA Academy across city theatres over the past decade. </p>
        <p>The star guest is Ray Quinn, runner up to Leona Lewis in X Factor who went on to perform in Grease and Dirty Dancing in the West End and is now recording his first album. As the MC, he gave a brief overview promising tap dancing, the splits and jazz hands, before introducing the junior school (aged 8 – 14) with their chorus of "Hushabye Mountain" from “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang”. </p>
        <p>Then the Diploma students kick off with a rousing rendition of Bernstein’s “New York, New York” from "On the Town". With the blast of a steam ship’s horn, the stage is filled with dozens of sailors and streetwise guys and gals in varied costumes from 40s’ fashion to modern “I heart NY” T- shirts: American accents are spot on, the dancing is slick and characterisation is crisp and cool with sassy performances in particular from Hannah Collins and Keziah Grace.</p>
        <p>This sense of confidence and high standard of theatricality flows on, from Jazz Age flair, a Glee Club medley and Hip Hop rhythm to a tap dancing routine. Impressive ensembles, with perhaps a hundred students, are seamlessly co-ordinated with meticulous dance steps creatively choreographed with pace and precision.</p>
        <p>The highlights from a packed programme include “Off with their Heads” featuring Caitlin Tipping in her glamorous red frock leading a Tiller Girls line up in white top hat and tails. From the musical Carousel, Georgia Fordyce and Ross Evans glide effortlessly in their beautiful, romantic pas de deux with delicate grace. </p>
        <p>2015 graduate, Natasha Barrie sings Des’ree’s ballad, “I’m Kissing You” from Romeo and Juliet, to which Nadia Kramer and Sonny Grieveson encapsulate the tragic fate of the lovers through mime and movement. And there's an hilarious episode from "The Producers" featuring the dancers in khaki shirts with swastika arm bands in “Hitler in Springtime”. </p>
        <p>What is amazing is the supersonic speed of costume changes as this vast cast of performers dash off into the wings, re-appearing a few minutes later, beautifully dressed for the next number. The artistic direction is inventve, taking over the theatre, such as singers crammed into the Boxes at times to complement action on stage. </p>
        <p>Ray Quinn, well known for his masterly Michael Buble crooner style, has his own star turn with a charming version of “Mr Bojangles”. </p>
        <p>In such an ambitious show, not surprising to see a few first night problems with the follow spot and the presenters need to tighten up the script and comic timing. But this is a minor quibble in an otherwise highly polished, professional and inspiring showcase. Congratulations are due to the fabulous cast as well as to the entire production team of choreogaphers, creative, lighting & musical directors. </p>
        <p>Forget Noel Coward’s advice in his song, “Don’t put your daughter on the stage, Mrs Worthington.” The passion, enthusiasm, energy and the pure joy of performance by these young students proudly illustrates the all-round musical theatre talent which is encouraged and nurtured at the MGA Academy of Performing Arts. 10/10 for TEN!. </p>

        <p>Kerry Ellis, famous for appearing in shows such as Wicked, Cats and We Will Rock You on Broadway and in London’s West End, travelled to Edinburgh to mentor the next generation of stage professionals during a workshop organised by Beyond Broadway Productions.</p>
        <p>Eighteen-year-old Sarah Dickson, a former pupil of Portobello High School who is now studying HND Musical Theatre at The MGA Academy, said: “I’m a huge fan of Kerry Ellis so it was amazing to have the opportunity to perform for her and get some advice on how I can improve. She talked to us about how important it is to choose the right songs for auditions and gave us some recommendations, which was really helpful.”</p>
        <p>Ashley Sutherland, who attended Craigmount High School before enrolling at The MGA Academy, added: “I loved taking part in the masterclass as Kerry was so lovely and gave us all great feedback. I decided to sing The Fire Within Me from Little Women for her as I want to sing it at auditions so thought it would be a great opportunity to get some advice from her about it.”</p>
        <p>The 19-year-old, who has loved performing since she was four years old, continued: “When I finish my training, I’d like to start auditioning for shows in London’s West End. Working with Kerry and hearing about her success has inspired me to really go for it.”</p>
        <p>Ellis herself said: “Working with aspiring professional performers is so rewarding for me. I was so impressed with the talent and willingness of The MGA Academy students to get up and perform for me. I loved how enthusiastic and eager to learn they all were.”</p>
        <p>Murray Grant, Creative Director of Beyond Broadway Productions, said: “We’ve been working to bring stars like Kerry Ellis, Shoshana Bean and Scott Alan to work with up-and-coming performers for the last ten years. Workshops like these give performers the chance to both work alongside, and gain feedback from, some of the biggest names in the industry.”</p>
        <p>The MGA Academy was founded ten years ago, providing a platform for Scottish talent in performing arts to remain in Scotland to obtain accredited SQA training at an equivalent level offered by established London colleges. West End star Fergal McGoff (Mamma Mia, The Bodyguard) and Rebecca Stenhouse (Legally Blonde, Rock of Ages) represent just a couple of success stories from The MGA Academy.</p>
        <p>Andrew Gowland, Managing Director of The MGA Academy of Performing Arts, said: “Many of our students go on to secure roles in London’s West End and beyond and workshops like these help prepare them for that.”</p>
        <p>On October 24, students from The MGA Academy will have the opportunity to share the stage with renowned New York theatre composer Jonathan Reid Gealt at a one-off concert in Edinburgh.</p>

        <p>They can enjoy a week of free classes, workshops and question-and-answer sessions at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh, during its Boys’ Scholarship Week. </p>
        <p>Doors will be thrown open to boys aged 14 and older with an interest in pursuing a career in performing arts from July 24-28, as part of a unique initiative to encourage more males into the industry. </p>
        <p>Those who attend will be given the opportunity to have fun while learning some tricks of the trade from guest tutors and staff from The MGA Academy, which recently became the first full-time professional training academy in Scotland to be awarded accreditation by CDET, the UK’s quality assurance and membership body for the professional dance, drama and musical theatre industries. </p>
        <p>International choreographer Murray Grant co-founded The MGA Academy with Andrew Gowland in 2005 to provide a platform for aspiring performers to remain in Scotland, while studying at a level equivalent to prestigious London colleges.</p>
        <p>He has previously performed in professional musical theatre, opera, and cabaret productions in Los Angeles, New York, Sydney and Vienna. </p>
        <p>Murray said: "I wanted to organise a project like this to give boys the opportunity to come along and meet others that share the same interests whilst learning more about acting, dancing and singing. </p>
        <p>"Many of our male graduates have gone onto great things, with Thomas Doherty now working for Disney and Fergal McGoff performing in London's West End. </p>
        <p>"We’d like to encourage more boys to consider pursuing careers in the industry. </p>
        <p>"When I was growing up, I was always the only boy in drama classes and I wish opportunities like Boys’ Scholarship Week had been available then. </p>
        <p>"It is completely free to attend but places are limited and must be booked in advance." </p>
        <p>Those interested in attending Boys’ Scholarship Week at The MGA Academy should call 0131 466 9392 or email murray@themgaacademy.com </p>

        <p>Murray, one of the founders of The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh, ran a masterclass at Razzamataz Theatre school in Carlisle to inspire the next generation of young performers. </p>
        <p>Murray has performed as a dancer all over the world, most notably in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Auckland, Chicago, Sydney and Vienna. </p>
        <p>He has performed in musical theatre shows such as The Merry Widow, Grease, Jesus Christ Superstar and Saturday Night Fever. </p>
        <p>In addition, he has also directed and choreographed the likes of Adam Garcia, Ruthie Henshall, Kerry Ellis, Christina Bianco, Louise Dearman, and Jon Lee. </p>
        <p>To give students a chance to understand what to expect and how to successfully audition for a performing arts college, Murray created a workshop that gives them a real understanding of the process involved. </p>
        <p>"As a performer, choreographer and teacher, it is a real privilege to meet and work with the next generation of performers," he said. </p>
        <p>"I’ve been really impressed with the training that the students receive at Razzamataz. </p>
        <p>"Learning the three disciplines of singing, dancing and acting in both musical theatre and commercial styles, will stand them in good stead when auditioning for colleges." </p>
        <p>In response to growing demand from students, Razzamataz launched a class designed to support students who wish to pursue a professional career within the performing arts industry. </p>
        <p>Razz Project Intense allows staff to teach in the specialist areas of dance to help build a strong technical skill base to equip the Razzamataz students with the correct guidance, skills and confidence to be better prepared for professional vocational college auditions. </p>
        <p>One of the many benefits from the classes are the workshops with industry experts, allowing the students to get a real feel for what it means to work as a professional performer.</p>
        <p>Debbie Mitchell, principal of Razzamataz Carlisle, said: "All the guest teachers who come to put on workshops are very generous with their time and give the students the opportunity to ask questions about working in the industry. </p>
        <p>“Not only does this give our students practical advice, but it is also very inspirational to have this level of support available." </p>
        <p>Murray adds: "The workshop really stretched the students and definitely gave them an idea about what we do at The MGA Academy every day. </p>
        <p>"The level of commitment and discipline from the students at Razzamataz means that whatever they choose to go on and do, they will have the right attitude to be successful." </p>
        <p>The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh currently runs three-year Musical Theatre, Dance and Acting Diplomas. </p>
        <p>It is the only CDET-accredited school in Scotland and is currently accepting applications for places on full- time courses starting in September. </p>
        <p>Auditions will take place in Newcastle (February 25), Edinburgh (March 18), and Dublin (March 25). </p>
