        <p>Applications doubled at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts last year, reaching 1,800 for 90 places, after it became the first institution in Scotland to receive a full accreditation from the Council for Dance, Drama and Musical Theatre. </p>
        <p>The academy, which employs 12 full-time staff and 45 contractors, expects revenues to nearly treble by 2023, from £1.3 million to £3.6m.</p>
        <p>It is also actively looking to expand its footprint, aiming to boost its current 15,000 square foot of studio and office space to 35,000sq ft.</p>
        <p>Co-founder Drew Gowland said the academy places a particular focus on the practical aspects of working as a performer, including regularly bringing in agents, union representatives, accountants and lawyers to share their insights.</p>
        <p>He said: “We make sure it is part of our on-going development. You can be the best performer in the world, but if you do not know how to write to an agent and sell yourself, then you will never get a job, and no one will ever see that talent.”</p>
        <p>Gowland, originally from Leeds, and his partner Murray Grant, from Edinburgh, secured an £85,000 loan in 2010 to establish their operation in a former Wheatsheaf pub in Balgreen, later adding two further venues as the academy grew.</p>
        <p>Recent graduates include West End performers Rhiannon Chesterman and Rebecca Stenhouse, as well as Disney film star Thomas Doherty, who will appear in the upcoming HBO/Sky mini series Catherine The Great, alongside Helen Mirren.</p>

        <p>The MGA Foundation will provide financial support to help with the fees required to attend a range of courses in singing, acting and musical theatre. </p>
        <p>Applicants will have to be able to demonstrate a genuine financial need and the potential to excel within the performing arts.</p>
        <p>The MGA Academy of Performing Arts has provided support for young people endeavouring to train professionally in Edinburgh since it was launched in 2010. The new MGA Foundation has been set up as a separate charity, which will broaden that access to include workshops, youth theatre and part-time and full-time training opportunities across the UK.</p>
        <p>Choreographer Murray Grant, a trustee of the new charity, told The Stage that setting it up was important to him because he could afford to attend Bird College in London only after he was given a full scholarship.</p>
        <p>He said: “Things are becoming more and more expensive and it is becoming a lot more out of the reach of a lot of talented people to be able to go to school and train.</p>
        <p>“That is not just full-time training, but kids going to summer schools and workshops and things like that. We, as a charity, want to give as many opportunities as possible to young people from Scotland in the performing arts.”</p>
        <p>In order to help the long-term sustainability of the charity, Grant said that those who were helped by it would be asked to commit to support it in the future.</p>
        <p>He said: “We want to make it a kind of a family thing where once you have had the scholarship for the three years of training and then you are then doing a West End show or whatever, you can then contribute to the foundation.</p>
        <p>“The hope is that, over the years, people who have been funded through the foundation will be paying for future generations in the way that we are doing it.”</p>
        <p>Details of how to apply for support from the MGA foundation and how to make donations to it are <a href="https://www.themgafoundation.org/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer"> available on its website</a>.</p>

        <p>A pair of young Dublin dance troops have been given the opportunity of a lifetime to learn tricks of the trade from a top international choreographer.</p>
        <p>Phoenix Performing Arts College and WestSide Performing Arts recently took part in a masterclass from international choreographer and performer Murray Grant.</p>
        <p>Murray visited Dublin to give youngsters from Phoenix Performing Arts College in East Wall and WestSide Performing Arts in Lucan an insight into what is expected of professional performers by guiding them through a fun and engaging masterclass.</p>
        <p>He said: “I had a great time working with the students in Dublin as they were all focused and keen to learn.</p>
        <p>"It was great to be able to travel to Dublin to share my passion for the industry and hopefully inspire some future stars of the stage from the area.”</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Ennis, creative director of WestSide Performing Arts, said: “Murray sharing his knowledge, passion and enthusiasm for the industry is an invaluable experience for our students.</p>
        <p>"His professionalism, caring attitude and high energy in the studio not only brings out the best of each dancer but encourages them to push out of their comfort zone and improve their technical and performance ability.</p>
        <p>“The opportunity to work with Murray has been one of the highlights of the terms for our students.”</p>
        <p>The MGA Academy of Performing Arts is currently accepting applications for auditions in Ireland in February next year.</p>
        <p>Auditions for places on full-time degree courses will take place in Dublin on Sunday 17 February, 2019. Candidates can apply at <a href="https://www.themgaacademy.com/apply/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">www.themgaacademy.com/apply</a>. </p>

        <p>This is a drop in café in the style of an airport lounge and it is now ready to welcome you if you just fancy a coffee or would-be performers who can go in and get career advice if they need it.</p>
        <p>It is a theatre-themed shop, resource and meeting place for local dancers, actors and performers.</p>
        <p>The Core on Glanville Place offers the opportunity to shop for all things theatrical, provide information on local performing arts events and offer guidance on opportunities to practise and train in performing arts across the city, including children’s classes, dance groups, and degree-level tuition. It will also host signings and talks by theatre stars, including performers from London’s West End.</p>
        <p>It is an unusual name and we asked Drew Gowland what was behind it. As a performer himself he knows all about the importance of the body’s core  to dancers and he explained the inspiration came from that.</p>
        <p>When you buy a coffee or a cake there is an optional donation to The MGA Foundation, the charity that will run the shop. This charitable organisation was established to enable performers to train for careers on stage regardless of their financial background.</p>
        <p>Drew Gowland co-founded the MGA Foundation along with Murray Grant said: “The Core shop will look and feel something like an inviting and relaxing airport lounge.</p>
        <p>“The shop will not only offer some incredible items for sale but it will also host regular events with some of the theatre’s biggest visiting stars so that our guests can meet and learn from the industry’s finest performers in a relaxed and accessible environment.</p>
        <p>“We will encourage people to pop in and engage with opportunities in dance, acting, and musical theatre in Edinburgh ‒ really any performing art, at any level, and for any age, audience or participant. We hope to do all of this whilst raising much needed money for The MGA Foundation.”</p>
        <p>With signed theatre memorabilia on the walls, the space will take on the atmosphere of a Hard Rock Café for stage aficionados, who will also be able to purchase show tickets across the UK at the shop’s on-site box office.</p>
        <p>The MGA Foundation was established earlier this year to ensure aspiring singers, dancers, actors and musical theatre performers are to be given financial freedom to pursue education in their chosen art at reputable schools across the UK.</p>
        <p>The founders of the charity, Drew Gowland and Murray Grant, have distributed more than £600,000 in tuition fees in the past ten years for students on part-time and full-time performing arts courses.</p>
        <p>Drew continued : “The establishment of a registered charity and our very own “charity shop (with a difference)” to continue our work and encourage even more people into performing arts training seemed like the natural next step.</p>
        <p>“It is so important that young people, regardless of their background, have the opportunity to find out about the wealth of opportunities out there in the performing arts and then be able to access them should they so wish.”</p>
        <p>Applications for funding from The MGA Foundation will be welcomed from mid-2019. Successful applications can secure funding to participate in classes, workshops, summer schools and youth theatre projects and even to train full-time on CDMT-accredited courses across the UK.</p>
        <p>The MGA Foundation is a Scottish registered charity (SC047592). For further information, visit  <a href="https://www.themgafoundation.org/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">www.themgafoundation.org</a> or email info@themgafoundation.org</p>
        <p>There will be a special Family Day will take place on December 18.</p>
        <p>At the recent opening carol singers performed – and wow they were great!</p>
